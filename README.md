# Who Knew the News

This is an entry to the [2021 Godot Fire Charity Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-fire-charity-jam-1), with the theme "Everything changes". What changes more than the news? (Perhaps the weather, but even that is considered news sometimes right?).

The game gives you a letter-scrambled title of a recent news article. Your goal is to unscramble the title in as few steps as possible, as quickly as possible.

Status: **WIP**

## Play the game

Play the game live in your webbrowser [on itch](https://theduckcow.itch.io/who-knows-the-news)!

Some workarounds had to be made in order for CORS to access the Google News RSS feed, and these workarounds might not be in place forever. At the very least, you can go through some built in puzzles packaged with the game.
